	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Organizational learning}: "change in the organization's knowledge that occurs as a function of experience" \citep[p. 31]{Argote2013}.
		\item \textit{Organizational forgetting}: "the loss, voluntary or otherwise, of organizational knowledge [which] often leads to a change in organizational capabilities because of the absence of some piece of knowledge" \citep[p. 1606]{DeHolan2004}.
		\note{Both forgetting and disruptions are thought to be sometimes positive, too, but I will not cover that here.\medbreak Disruption also sometimes desdribed as merely "interacting" with forgetting (Anderson \& Lewis 2014).\medbreak}
		\item \textit{Disruptions}: "organizational change-inducing events" \citep[p. 362]{Anderson2014}
		\note{Will have examples of disruptions in the next couple of slides.}

		\note{You have probably seen this before. Read out caption. So in our context, we could imagine an organization operating its pipeline and equipment, getting better at it, making less mistakes, having less incidents. The organization in charge of pipeline safety is a suborganization.}

	\end{figure}
	\note{We see more than in the last picture. This is the production of the Lockheed L-1011. Famous for being an amazing plane, but a commercial failure. What happend here, around 150 units? Economic downturn, production was disrupted. Then, company decided the only way to break even is to produce a certain number of planes, but that did not happen.}

	\end{figure}
	\note{This is what actually happened. After Lockheed increased production again, the number of man-hours per plane actually increased for a while, before it decreased again. In our context, we could imagine a pipeline operator operating a pipeline for many years, then shutting it off for a while, before resuming operations. Knowledge would be lost, especially if the shut-off went hand in hand with lay-offs, and if the company had to hire new staff later.}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Turnover \citep{DeHolan2004,Rao2006}
		\note{Relate sources of forgetting to our context.\medbreak When a large number and/or key employees leave a company, and knowledge and/or networks are lost as a result. Which is also acknowledges in the wider learning literature.\medbreak}
		\item Loss of recorded knowledge
		\item Technology becoming irrelevant
		\item Decay of social networks \citep{Argote2013_3,Argote1990,Thompson2007}
		\item Disruption
		\item 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Internal
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Disruption of regular production 
					\item Technology \citep{Amburgey1993,Edmondson2001}
					\item Restructuring/reorganization/layoffs (or even hirings) \citep{Benkard2000,Anderson2014}
				\end{itemize}
			\item External
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Economic cycles \citep{Rockart2019}
					\item Natural disasters \citep{Anderson2014}
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\note{Organizational disruption is special case of organizational forgetting. Disruption can stem from inside, or outside of the organization.}
